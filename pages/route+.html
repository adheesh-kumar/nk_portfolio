        <h4 style="margin-top: 2%;">Problem Statement</h4>
        <div class="subtext" style="margin-top: 1%; font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans';">
            Visitors at Canada's Wonderland often experience long wait times of over 2 hours, causing frustration and a less enjoyable experience.
        </div>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 2%;">Research</h4>

        <div class="subtext" style="margin-top: 1%;">
            <span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans';">Usability Testing Summary:</span>  
            <br>
            The goal of the usability tests was to assess the app’s functionality, ease of navigation, and user experience. A series of tests were conducted using the think-aloud protocol, where participants verbalized their thoughts as they navigated through the app.
            <br>
            <br>
            <span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans';">Key Findings:</span>  
            <br>
            <br>

            <span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans';">1. Route Setting & Personalization:</span> 
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 4% !important;">
                <li>
                    Users generally appreciated the route-setting feature but wanted more clarity in the process (e.g., additional instructions on how to scan wristbands).
                </li>
                <li>
                    The ability to set personalized routes was well-received, though some users felt the interface was overwhelming with too much information displayed at once.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Suggestions included allowing for different routes per group member and simplifying the process of setting preferences.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans';">2. Wait Times & Ride Information:</span> 
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 4% !important;">
                <li>
                    Participants were able to find wait times, but some expressed confusion about the search bar functionality and filter options.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There was a consistent desire for more detailed information about rides (e.g., brief descriptions and categorization) and clearer visibility of wait times.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Suggestions included adding ride types (e.g., thrill, swing) and categorizing rides by location (e.g., medieval area, kids' area).
                </li>
            </ul>

            <span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans';">3. Map & Navigation:</span> 
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 4% !important;">
                <li>
                    Users appreciated the map feature but wanted it to be more interactive, with clearer labeling and visual cues like icons for rides and facilities (e.g., washrooms, food).
                </li>
                <li>
                    A heatmap feature was suggested for showing popular areas, including food and ride wait times.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The map was expected to show real-time updates (e.g., wait times, current locations) and provide navigation options with step-by-step directions.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans';">4. Interface & Design:</span> 
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 4% !important;">
                <li>
                    Participants found certain text sizes too small and suggested improving button labels and text contrast for better visibility.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Feedback on the color scheme was mixed, with some users suggesting a more dynamic palette or clearer distinctions between different elements (e.g., wait times).
                </li>
                <li>
                    There were requests for additional customization options, such as personalizing the user interface based on preferences (e.g., thrill-seekers vs. family-friendly).
                </li>
            </ul>

            <span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans';">5. User Flow & Functionality:</span> 
            <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 4% !important;">
                <li>
                    Participants were often unsure of how to navigate through certain features, such as adding rides to their routes or understanding notification content.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The need for better onboarding and clearer explanations of app functionality was emphasized.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Some users struggled with filters and search functions, suggesting the need for a more intuitive and responsive interface.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <br>
            <br>

            <span style="font-family: 'IBM Plex Sans';">Overall, the usability tests highlighted key areas for improvement, particularly in terms of simplifying user interactions, enhancing navigation, and providing more detailed and accessible information. The feedback collected has been invaluable for refining the app’s design and ensuring a smoother, more enjoyable user experience.</span>
