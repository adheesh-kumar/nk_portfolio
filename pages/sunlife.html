                The role of Digital Web Publisher has been crucial in ensuring the successful delivery of content across various regional websites and ensuring adherence to strict UX guidelines. Through the use of CMS software, each page—whether product-focused, client-service oriented, or educational in nature—was meticulously published, ensuring the brand’s message was consistent and tailored to different markets.
                <br>
                <br>
                By following detailed UX guidelines provided by the UX team, the publishing process upheld the integrity of design, color schemes, spacing, and asset usage for each regional site. The publishing workflow, which included managing multiple subpages for each section, played a pivotal role in maintaining the seamless user experience that Sun Life is known for.

                The comprehensive structure of the websites, with diverse page types such as product information, educational resources, and customer portals, demonstrates the scale and complexity of Sun Life's digital presence. The ongoing management and optimization of these digital assets is key to meeting both the needs of their customers and the business’s goals of engagement, accessibility, and brand consistency.
